    "Add a columnar board view (Queued / Scanning / Running / Review / Blocked / Done / Failed) alongside the existing NebulaView table",
    "Show live quasar (worker) detail cards beneath the board columns with cycle, token, and claim info",
    "Introduce tab navigation (Board | Entanglements | Scratchpad) below the status bar",
    "Build an entanglement viewer tab displaying interface agreements between coupled phases from the fabric",
    "Build a scratchpad tab fed by the telemetry bridge as a shared, read-mostly viewport",
    "Enhance the hail overlay to float above the board with inline text input for human decisions",

constraints = [
    "Preserve the existing galactic color theme, logo, and splash animation exactly as they are",
    "Keep NebulaView as a toggle-able alternative — the board is an additional view mode, not a replacement",
    "Reuse existing Lip Gloss styles from styles.go wherever possible; extend only when needed",
    "Follow the existing Bridge/message pattern — BoardView consumes MsgPhase* and new Msg* types from the fabric nebula",
    "Do not introduce external dependencies beyond what is already in go.mod",
    "All new components must have corresponding test files using stdlib testing only",
    "Adaptive layout: degrade gracefully on narrow terminals (< 80 cols) by collapsing to the existing table view",
    "Use canonical vocabulary exclusively: Fabric, Entanglement, Claim, Discovery, Hail, Quasar (worker), Epoch, Neutron",
