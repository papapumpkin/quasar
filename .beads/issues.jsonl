Here's my review:\n\n---\n\n## Review Summary\n\nThe coder's summary describes issues they *identified* but **could not fix** due to permission problems. The code as it stands has partial implementation of the failure/recovery feature: the worker correctly sets `TaskStatusFailed` and blocks dependents, and there's a passing test for this. However, several critical pieces are missing for the full feature as described in the task.\n\nISSUE:\nSEVERITY: major\nDESCRIPTION: **`BuildPlan` doesn't handle `TaskStatusFailed`**: When a task has `TaskStatusFailed` in state, `BuildPlan` falls through to the \"bead exists → ActionUpdate\" path (line 107-126 of plan.go). There is no `ActionRetry` type, so re-running `nebula apply` after a failure will attempt to \"update\" the failed task rather than properly retrying it. The task explicitly asks that \"another Quasar command [can] pick off where the last failure occurred.\" Add a `TaskStatusFailed` case in `BuildPlan` and an `ActionRetry` type + handler in `Apply` to reset the task to `TaskStatusCreated` (or directly re-queue it).\n\nISSUE:\nSEVERITY: major\nDESCRIPTION: **`NebulaShow` doesn't visually distinguish failed tasks**: The `show` command renders all statuses identically (line 279 of ui.go). The task requires failure state to be \"visible in validate, plan, show commands.\" Color-code the status (red+bold for failed, green for done, etc.) and display the failure reason if a `FailureReason` field is added to `TaskState`.\n\nISSUE:\nSEVERITY: major\nDESCRIPTION: **`NebulaValidateResult` and `NebulaPlan` don't surface failure info**: The `validate` command doesn't report failed task counts from state, and the `plan` command's `NebulaPlan` has no display case for a retry action.

This causes the Serena MCP server to auto-activate and pop up its UI on every invocation.\n\n**Fix**: Add `--strict-mcp-config` to the Claude CLI arguments in `internal/claude/claude.go`. This flag tells the Claude CLI to \"only use MCP servers from `--mcp-config`\" — since quasar doesn't pass any `--mcp-config`, the result is zero MCP servers loaded, preventing Serena (and any other MCP) from activating during automated runs.\n\n**The exact change** (1 line addition in `internal/claude/claude.go`, line 24):\n\n```go\n// Before:\nargs := []string{\n    \"-p\", prompt,\n    \"--output-format\", \"json\",\n}\n\n// After:\nargs := []string{\n    \"-p\", prompt,\n    \"--output-format\", \"json\",\n    \"--strict-mcp-config\", // Disable all MCP servers (e.g. Serena) for automated invocations.\n}\n```\n\nI've been unable to write the change because file write permissions haven't been granted for this session.

Since `Invoke` builds a `cmd` internally, the test should use a mock/stub Claude binary (a shell script that echoes its args) to verify the flag is passed.\n\n### 3. `README.md` — Document the behavior\n\nAdd a note in the Safety section explaining that quasar invokes Claude with `--strict-mcp-config` to prevent MCP server UI interruptions during automated cycles.\n\n---\n\n**I was unable to write any files due to permission restrictions.** The user/orchestrator needs to grant write permissions for:\n- `Edit` tool writes to `internal/claude/claude.go`  \n- `Write` tool for creating `internal/claude/claude_test.go`\n- `Edit` tool writes to `README.md`\n- Or `mcp__serena__replace_symbol_body` MCP tool permissions","created_at":"2026-02-14T21:09:39Z"},{"id":67,"issue_id":"quasar-ayh","author":"Aaron","text":"[reviewer cycle 5]\nGood — the `--strict-mcp-config` flag does exist, but there's an important nuance: it needs to be used with `--mcp-config '{}'` to actually disable MCP servers.

All three target files are unmodified:\n- `internal/claude/claude.go` — no `--strict-mcp-config` flag added\n- `internal/claude/claude_test.go` — file does not exist\n- `README.md` — no documentation added\n\n**Assessment of the proposed approach:** The coder's plan to add just `\"--strict-mcp-config\"` to the args is incomplete. Per [Claude Code documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/mcp) and [issue #14490](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14490), you need **both** `--strict-mcp-config` and `--mcp-config '{}'` (an empty MCP config) to effectively prevent project-level MCP servers from loading.

Let me review the changes thoroughly:\n\n## Review\n\n### What changed\n\n**`internal/claude/claude.go`:**\n1. Extracted the duplicated CLAUDECODE-stripping logic from both `Invoke()` and `Validate()` into a new `buildEnv()` function — good refactoring, DRY.\n2. Added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MCP_POPUPS=1` to the env in `buildEnv()` — the core fix for the bead.\n3. Both `Invoke()` and `Validate()` now call `buildEnv(os.Environ())`.\n\n**`internal/claude/claude_test.go`:**\n1. Added `strings` import for the new tests.\n2. `TestBuildEnv_StripsCLAUDECODE` — tests that CLAUDECODE entries are filtered out.\n3. `TestBuildEnv_SuppressesMCPPopups` — tests that the MCP popup suppression env var is present.\n\n### Assessment\n\n**Correctness:** ✅ The env var `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MCP_POPUPS=1` is correctly appended. The refactoring correctly preserves the existing CLAUDECODE stripping behavior while adding the new functionality. Both `Invoke` and `Validate` benefit from the fix.\n\n**Code quality:** ✅ The refactoring from inline logic to `buildEnv()` is a clear improvement — eliminates duplication and makes the function independently testable. Good doc comment on `buildEnv`.\n\n**Tests:** ✅ Both new tests are well-structured and verify the key behaviors. The tests use a controlled `base` slice rather than `os.Environ()`, which is correct for unit testing.\n\n**Security:** ✅ No security concerns — this just adds an env var to subprocess invocations.\n\n**Edge cases:** The capacity hint `len(base)+1` correctly accounts for the one extra env var appended. No risk of duplicate `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_MCP_POPUPS` entries from the base since it's unconditionally appended (and even if `base` had one, having it twice in env is harmless — last value wins on most systems).\n\n**Public CLI interface:** ✅ No changes to the CLI surface — this is purely internal subprocess env configuration.\n\n**Coder summary accuracy:** The summary mentioned \"fixed unused imports\" (`context`, `os`...
